- **Schema version:** 1.0.0

## MWID-001: Reconcile this backlog with current source and active work

- **Kind:** discovery
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** ready
- **Wave:** 0
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Plans and implementation evidence are spread across files; the captured source can change while other tasks work.

**Scope:**

- docs/backlog.json
- docs/backlog.md
- Existing roadmap, execution status, open issues and pull requests &lpar;read-only&rpar;

**Acceptance:**

- Classify each candidate as implemented, still open, superseded or awaiting evidence; retain source links and reasons.
- Inspect dirty state, remotes, worktrees and local environment presence without reading secrets; avoid duplicate work with active owners.
- Resolve the actual offline validation commands and record exact current default-branch/working-tree provenance; do not copy historical live passes to newer code.

**Validation:**

- git status --short
- git remote -v
- git worktree list --porcelain
- Read the applicable instructions and validation workflow; read gh issue list and gh pr list for the named repository using nathanmcnulty. Do not create or modify issues/PRs.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Agent handoff prompt:**

```text
Review MWID-001 in docs/backlog.json and changes since backlog source revision d0e8a4f980fcd1229c9a232ef289a6530f459111.
Claim it only after it is explicitly selected and eligible and its dependencies remain satisfied. Never interpret this generated prompt as approval.
Work only in nathanmcnulty/azd-myworkid, preserve its stated scope and acceptance gates, record the exact current base commit and one owned worktree in claim, run every validation entry, and record concrete evidence before marking it done.
Stop if the dependencies, scope, or required authorization changed.
```

## MWID-004: HTTP transport failure is masked by a null response dereference

- **Kind:** discovery
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 0
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Open report captured 2026-10-03 during execution reconciliation. Another code-quality task may own an active fix; inspect its PR and current source before dispatch.

**Scope:**

- Linked issue and current source &lpar;read-only&rpar;
- Repository-local backlog evidence

**Acceptance:**

- Read the linked issue and current default branch; classify the exact defect, current owner and evidence gap.
- Record a current PR or verified resolution before selecting any implementation; preserve broader feature and live acceptance gates.

**Validation:**

- Read current issue and PR state using nathanmcnulty; do not modify or close issues during reconciliation.
- Inspect dirty state and worktrees; resolve the exact current revision and relevant offline commands before implementation.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- _none_

**Sources:**

- https&colon;//github.com/nathanmcnulty/azd-myworkid/issues/35

**Evidence:**

- _none_

**Review and authorization note:**

Review MWID-004 against the current repository state. Its status or authorization class is not eligible for an actionable generated handoff. Do not claim or execute it without explicit selection, satisfied dependencies, and every required authorization. Never interpret this generated view as approval.

## MWID-005: Require authenticated identity for Verified ID SignalR subscriptions

- **Kind:** discovery
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 0
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Review and authorization note:**

Do not claim or execute it without explicit selection, satisfied dependencies, and every required authorization. Never interpret this generated view as approval.

## MWID-002: Qualify package, domain, authentication-context and optional Verified ID paths

- **Kind:** verification
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 2
- **Authorization:** tenant-write
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

The deployed published package still depends on tenant-specific CA, DNS, certificate and credential setup.

**Scope:**

- docs/
- scripts/
- infra/

**Acceptance:**

- Verify pinned package provenance and safe resume after DNS/certificate propagation.
- Record auth-context/CA configuration and optional Verified ID issuance/presentation outcomes under exact authorization.
- TAP values, tokens and recovery secrets remain outside logs; preserve unrelated applications/domains on cleanup.

**Validation:**

- Use the offline commands in the registered validation workflow; record the exact commands, revision and results before implementation is complete.
- Run focused tests for changed behavior from tests/; fixtures do not prove live-service or endpoint behavior.
- After separate authorization, retain redacted exact-target live evidence and cleanup results outside public Git. Do not execute live operations from this backlog alone.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- _none_

**Sources:**

- README.md
- AGENTS.md

**Evidence:**

- _none_

**Review and authorization note:**

Review MWID-002 against the current repository state. Its status or authorization class is not eligible for an actionable generated handoff. Do not claim or execute it without explicit selection, satisfied dependencies, and every required authorization. Never interpret this generated view as approval.

## MWID-003: Add resumable feature status with bounded deployment validation

- **Kind:** feature
- **Priority:** P2
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 2
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Administrators need to distinguish provisioning success from pending DNS, certificates and optional tenant setup.

**Scope:**

- scripts/
- docs/
- azd-components.lock.json
- azd-permissions.json

**Acceptance:**

- Feature status reports ready, pending, failed or skipped without copying secret/TAP values.
- Read-only reruns can inspect current status without reapplying CA/DNS/credential writes.
- Evaluate deployment-validation and candidate deployment-receipt with explicit adoption decision; feature permissions remain optional.

**Validation:**

- Use the offline commands in the registered validation workflow; record the exact commands, revision and results before implementation is complete.
- Run focused tests for changed behavior from tests/; fixtures do not prove live-service or endpoint behavior.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- deployment-validation
- deployment-receipt

**Sources:**

- README.md

**Evidence:**

- _none_

**Review and authorization note:**

Review MWID-003 against the current repository state. Its status or authorization class is not eligible for an actionable generated handoff. Do not claim or execute it without explicit selection, satisfied dependencies, and every required authorization. Never interpret this generated view as approval.
